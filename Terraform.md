## Terraform(IaC Tool) using Azure
### Terraform basics
- Terraform is a tool that helps you manage and automate the setup of your infrastructure (like virtual machines, databases, networks, etc.) using code.
- Tool for infrastructure provisioning
  
🔧 `Purpose`
Terraform: Builds and provisions infrastructure (servers, networks, cloud resources).
Ansible: Configures and manages software and settings on infrastructure.

⚙️ `How They Work`
Terraform: Uses declarative language (you describe the desired state).
Ansible: Mostly procedural (you write the steps to reach the state).

🔁 `State Management`
Terraform: Maintains a state file to track resources.
Ansible: Stateless; it checks the current state during each run.

☁️ `Use Cases`
Terraform: Ideal for cloud provisioning (AWS, Azure, GCP).
Ansible: Best for configuration management (installing packages, setting configs).

### Terraform files
- State File (terraform.tfstate)
 - The state file is crucial for tracking the current state of your infrastructure. Terraform maintains a record of all the resources it manages in this file. It is automatically generated and updated as Terraform applies changes to the infrastructure.

`Issues in tfstate file`
- If two people are working on the same project and making changes at the same time, a conflict may occur.

`Resolve`
- To resolve this conflict, we can enable state locking so that only one operation can modify the tfstate file at a time.

### Terraform versions
- `=` Exaact version
- `!=` Exclude the exact version
- `>, >=, <, <=` Allow version when comparision is true.
- `~>` Only allow the right most increment
	Eg: ~> 1.0.4 (Tf can install 1.0.5, 1.0.10 But not 1.1.0)
	    ~? 1.1 (Tf can install 1.2, 1.10 but not 2.0)











### Terraform basic commands
- **`terraform init`**    - Initializes the Terraform working directory.

- **`terraform plan`** - Creates an execution plan (dry run).
	-    **Created**: Resources that don’t exist yet, according to the configuration, are marked as `+ create`.
        
    -   **Updated**: Resources that need changes are marked as `~ update`.
        
    -   **Destroyed**: Resources that are no longer in the configuration are marked as `- destroy`.
